# Naval Combat Management System 

The domain of military and operational Command and Control systems is characterized by a huge variety of underlying computing platforms. A standard-based interface to common TACtical SITuation (TACSIT) services is thus essential for interoperable and open systems. In this scope, a first standard has already been issued by the OMG: the TACSIT Controller Interface consists of set of interfaces to interact with TACSIT display systems. This specification offers data interfaces to TACSIT systems. The domain of naval Combat Management Systems is characterized by a huge variety of underlying computing platforms, with different and often incompatible means of managing and reporting alerts. Standards-based alert management services are essential for interoperable and open systems. This specification is a standard for ALert MAnagement Service (ALMAS) in CMS systems, consisting of a standard alerts data model and a model for an alert delivery and lifecycle management service. The OARIS specification facilitates information exchange between the external environment and the command team, by defining a layered subsystem to the CMS interface. ODIN aims to become an Open Source alternative to industry-led commercial Command and Control Information Systems. Delta3d is an open source software simulation engine API. A CGF (Computer Generated Force) is a computer program that allows virtual forces to be used in simulations. This is a complementary project related to OpenBattleSim and consists of a standalone Scenario Generator that players will be able to use to create customized environments ready to use in OpenBattlesim. OpenBattleSim is a military simulator written in Rust, GDScript and made in Godot. OpenRocket is a free, fully featured model rocket simulator that allows you to design and simulate your rockets before actually building and flying them. Sniper is a next-generation parallel, high-speed, and accurate x86 simulator
