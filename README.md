# Combat Management System Simulation

Delta3D is a simulation engine for building military training system. The Advanced Framework for Simulation, Integration, and Modeling (AFSIM) is a government-owned, open-source and community-informed military simulation framework. The CLARITY project consists in developing and structuring an ecosystem of major actors centered on the open-source model-based systems engineering solution Capella and its extensions. Scilab/Xcos is one of them. The domain of naval Combat Management Systems is characterized by a huge variety of underlying computing platforms. A standard-based interface to common TACtical SITuation (TACSIT) services and standards-based alert management services are essential for interoperable and open systems. The OARIS specification facilitates information exchange between the external environment and the command team, by defining a layered subsystem to the CMS interface. United Architecture Framework (UAF): Assists in development of architectural descriptions in commercial industry firms, federal government agencies and defense organizations. Command and Control – Simulation Interoperation (C2SIM). ODIN aims to become an Open Source alternative to industry-led commercial Command and Control Information Systems. C Model Developer CMD is an open-source C source code based environment for building simulations of systems described by time-based differential equations. Boomslang is a C2 simulator that provides an open-source tool to simulate new C2 doctrines and exercises. Scikit-Criteria is a collection of Multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) methods. Protocol for composing Distributed DEVS Models Across different Simulation Frameworks. The ARL Hierarchical MultiScale Framework (ARL-HMS) is a software library for development of multiscale models on heterogeneous high-performance computing systems. OpenMAS streamlines asynchronous Multi-Agent System (MAS) development in Python.
