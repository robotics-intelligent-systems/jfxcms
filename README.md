# Naval Combat Management System 

Combat management systems (CMS) are the central operational backbone for aircraft carrier anti-ship missile defense. They integrate data from multiple sensors and radars to generate a comprehensive operational picture, enabling rapid threat assessment and decision-making. ODIN aims to become an Open Source alternative to industry-led commercial Command and Control Information Systems. A CGF (Computer Generated Force) is a computer program that allows virtual forces to be used in simulations. This is a complementary project related to OpenBattleSim and consists of a standalone Scenario Generator that players will be able to use to create customized environments ready to use in OpenBattlesim. OpenBattleSim is a military simulator written in Rust, GDScript and made in Godot. OpenRocket is a free, fully featured model rocket simulator that allows you to design and simulate your rockets before actually building and flying them. Sniper is a next-generation parallel, high-speed, and accurate x86 simulator
