# Naval Combat Management System 

Combat management systems (CMS) are the central operational backbone for aircraft carrier anti-ship missile defense. They integrate data from multiple sensors and radars to generate a comprehensive operational picture, enabling rapid threat assessment and decision-making. OpenBattleSim is a military simulator written in Rust, GDScript and made in Godot.
