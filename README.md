# Naval Combat Management System 

The CLARITY project consists in developing and structuring an ecosystem of major actors centered on the open-source model-based systems engineering solution Capella and its extensions. Scilab/Xcos is one of them. A standard-based interface to common TACtical SITuation (TACSIT) services is thus essential for interoperable and open systems. In this scope, a first standard has already been issued by the OMG: the TACSIT Controller Interface consists of set of interfaces to interact with TACSIT display systems. This specification offers data interfaces to TACSIT systems. The domain of naval Combat Management Systems is characterized by a huge variety of underlying computing platforms, with different and often incompatible means of managing and reporting alerts. Standards-based alert management services are essential for interoperable and open systems. This specification is a standard for ALert MAnagement Service (ALMAS) in CMS systems, consisting of a standard alerts data model and a model for an alert delivery and lifecycle management service. The OARIS specification facilitates information exchange between the external environment and the command team, by defining a layered subsystem to the CMS interface. United Architecture Framework (UAF): Assists in development of architectural descriptions in commercial industry firms, federal government agencies and defense organizations. ODIN aims to become an Open Source alternative to industry-led commercial Command and Control Information Systems. Libcanard is a compact implementation of the Cyphal/CAN protocol stack in C99/C11 for high-integrity real-time embedded systems. Cyphal is an open lightweight data bus standard designed for reliable intravehicular communication in aerospace and robotic applications via CAN bus, Ethernet, and other robust transports.
